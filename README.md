Summary: The page teaches about different ways to use arrays in JavaScript. It shows how to do things like going through each item in an array, making a new array, picking out certain items, combining arrays, and checking if something is an array. It's great for learning how to work with arrays in JavaScript, and it's good for both beginners and people who know more already.
The array methods in JavaScript help in performing various tasks with arrays.
- The forEach() method allows you to go through each item in the array and do something with it. 
- The map() method helps in creating a new array by changing each item in the original array. 
- The filter() method creates a new array with items that meet a certain condition. 
- The reduce() method combines all the items in the array into a single value. 
- The indexOf() method gives you the position of a specific item in the array. 
- The find() method returns the first item in the array that matches a condition. 
- The slice() method cuts out a part of the array to make a new one. 
- The splice() method can change the contents of the array by adding, removing, or replacing items. 
- The sort() method puts the items in the array in order. 
- The concat() method joins two or more arrays together. 
- The isArray() method checks if something is an array.

Summary: Basically, this page teaches about function in JavaScript, we have these cool things called "functions." They are like magic spells that we can make and use in our code. 
1. Making Spells (Creating Functions): We can make our own spells by giving them a name and telling them what they should do. It's like teaching a magic wand a new trick. 
2. Using Spells (Calling Functions): Once we teach our magic wand a trick, we can use it anytime. We just say its name, and the magic happens. 
3. Ingredients (Parameters): Sometimes, when we use a spell, we might need to give it special ingredients so it knows exactly what to do. It's like telling our magic wand more details about the trick. 
4. Results (Return): After our magic wand does its trick, it can give us something in return. It's like getting a surprise gift! 
5. Magical Memory (Variables): Functions can also remember things for us, like a magical memory. We can ask them about it later, and they'll tell us what they remember. 
Functions are like little helpers that make it easier to do big and exciting things with our computer.

Summary:  The MDN documentation on JavaScript functions is like a book that teaches us all about how to use special tools called functions in JavaScript. It talks about: 
1. Making Spells (Function Declarations and Expressions): It explains how to write down our spells using different ways 2. Special Ingredients (Function Parameters and Arguments): It tells us how to set up the rules for our spells and handle the stuff we give them. 
3. Scope and Closures (Function Scope and Closures): It talks about how spells can use things around them and what happens when they do their magic. 
4. Magic Spell Time (Function Invocations): It shows us how to make our spells work and different ways to do it using special words. 
5. Fancy New Spells (Arrow Functions): It teaches us about a new way to write spells that is shorter and cooler. 
6. Talking About Spells (Function Objects): It tells us about the things that come with our spells and how they work.
7. Making Spells in a Different Way (Function Constructor): It talks about a different way to make spells using special words. 
8. Special Pause and Play Spells (Generator Functions): It explains spells that can pause and start again whenever we want. 
9. Special Words for Spells (Function-related Statements): It talks about special words we can use with our spells. 
10. Decorating Spells (Function Decorators): There's a quick talk about making our spells fancier. 
The MDN book is great for learning about spells and how to use them, no matter if we're just starting or already know a lot about magic in JavaScript.

Summary:  This page is basically about  Control flow statements and it states that they're a fundamental part of any programming language, including JavaScript. They allow you to control the order in which statements are executed in your program, based on certain conditions or criteria. In JavaScript, there are three main types of control flow statements listed blow:
1. if/else statements
2. switch statements
3. loops.

link 5: https://javascript.info/function-basics

Summary: The "javascript.info" page is like a fun storybook that teaches us about special things called "functions" in JavaScript. Below are basically what it talks about: 
1. Introduction to Functions: It starts by telling us that functions are like magical spells that can do special things. 2. Function Declaration: It talks about how we can write down our own spells using special words and give them a name. It also shows us how to give our spells special instructions. 
3. Function Expressions: It explains another way to make our spells by putting them inside special boxesâ€”just like toys in a toy box! 
4. Arrow Functions: It teaches us about a new, shorter way to make small spells that do quick jobs. 
5. Local Variables: It tells us that our spells can have their own little secrets that only they know about. 
6. Returning a Value: It talks about how our spells can give us special surprises after they finish their magic. 
7. Naming Conventions: It talks about using good names for our spells and making them easy to understand. 
8. Function Expression vs. Function Declaration: It shows us the differences between two ways to make spells and when to use each one. 
9. Function Call: It explains how we can tell our spells to start doing their magic and give them things to work with. 10. Default Values for Parameters: It teaches us how to make sure our spells still work even if we forget to give them something. 
11. The Empty Return: It tells us about what happens when we forget to ask our spells for a surprise. The "javascript.info" storybook is a great place to learn about magic spells in JavaScript, whether we're just starting or want to learn more!
